#Summary
Class project for software design document.  

#Who is the client?
Imaginary client The Gaming Room wanted to make a picture intense mobile party game.

#What type of software did they want?
client wanted software recomendations for their app project.

#What did I do well?
The material was new, I did well in learning new information and presenting it as if knowledgeable.

#What was helpful about this design document when developing code?
A design document is useful so that a team can sit down to develop code, with important decisions being made in advance.

#What part of this document would you improve?
The Requirements tab is a little open ended.  More specific details would fit in a section titled 'Requirements'

#How did you interpret the user's needs and implement into the software design?
The goal of the app is a party game, so design is incomplete until it delivers the proper experience.  The user needed to transfer images quickly, this was an anticipated obstacle to be smoothed out.

#How did you approach designing software?
For this class, a blank template was given.  I used it as a roadmap and researched each part to deliver an answer one by one.  For a future project, I would likely refer to the blank template provided to me in this class.
